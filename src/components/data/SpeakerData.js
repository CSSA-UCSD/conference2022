        bio: "Stephanie is a neuroscientist specializing in the cognitive neuroscience of human language. She received her PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Aix-Marseille University in France (where she’s from), and then did a 5.5 years postdoc at UC Berkeley. Her areas of interest include neuroscience, psycholinguistics, speech and language disorders, and brain plasticity. Stephanie uses different electrophysiology (surface and intracranial electroencephalography and electromyography) and brain imaging methods to study the brain dynamics of control processes in language production in healthy speakers and in individuals with language disorders. Her work seeks to shed light on how the brain reorganizes in populations with brain disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and brain tumors, and how cognitive control processes are engaged in compensatory processes for language recovery. She has been at SDSU since Fall 2016 and there she teaches undergraduate classes in neuroanatomy and neurogenic disorders, and anatomy of physiology of speech, and a graduate student seminar on grant writing. When not in the lab or the university, she likes to spend time with her family and explore San Diego County and the great Southwest!",

I have been in Dr. Geller's Learning and Instruction in Multimedia Environments (LIME) lab for just over two years researching the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. I am interested in the idea of learning, specifically learning from multimedia presentations, and how different factors of video play a role in this. My current project is an exploratory study attempting to measure cognitive load and relate it to how much people learn from watching video lessons on the same topic! In the future, I hope to expand on this idea and eventually study the most beneficial ways information can be taught to make it easiest for students to learn.   ",
